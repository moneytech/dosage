A version of Taito's original Space Invaders(TM) for the PC

********** BORING STUFF

This game is freeware. That is, it's free to use and distribute anywhere you
like, but only on condition that you keep the three files (INV78-02.EXE,
INV78-02.TXT and INV78-02.BAS) together and that you don't charge any payment
for it.

Also, I cannot be held responsible if this program does anything nasty to your
machine. It hasn't damaged anyone's PC that I'm aware of and there's no reason
why it should, really.


********** 	PLAY THE GAME

Type "inv78-02" at the DOS command prompt.

Left         - Left CTRL
Right        - Left ALT
Fire         - Right SHIFT
Stop program - Esc


********** WAFFLE

Having tried a number of Space Invader 'clones' for the PC I decided to write
one that was more like the original - most of the clones are rather different.
My interest in the game is just nostalgia - playing Taito's Space Invaders
around 1979, aged 11, was my introduction to computers. It seemed magical to
me, and I was fascinated from that point on in working out how an inanimate
object comprising a bunch of electronics, some memory, a VDU, and some input
controls could offer such unlimited possibilities. So, 17 years after first
grappling with a computer game, here's my little tribute to it and to the
company who made it.

Version 1.0 was mailware - I asked people to mail me if they got the game.
Around 10,000 emails later, I'm genuinely delighted at the response, but
it's more than I can cope with now, so there's no email address anymore.

Some of the emails were amazing - the game was used for things I never dreamt
of. I thought it would just be a few people playing it on their PCs, but it was
used as a demo for a a PC emulator, Nintendo Mexico bundled it on a range of
home PCs, some schoolchildren projected it onto their classroom wall, one
person created a 3D version, a music/multimedia group in San Francisco used the
sound effects in a project, it was on the CD in the IDG book 'Windows Game
Programming for Dummies', and it ended up on lots of magazine cover disks
around the world. Not bad for such a cruddy little program :-)


********** REQUIREMENTS

Basically, don't worry - it'll almost certainly work on your PC.

Requires:
---------

DOS - tested with MS-DOS 6.22 and Windows 3/95. No known lower limit. I don't
know if it works with Windows 2000 or Windows ME. Several people have said it
works ok with Windows NT3 and NT4.

VGA - tested with ET4000, ET6000 and ATI Rage cards, and lots of people have
reported it works with a variety of other cards. It uses screen 13:
320x200x256.

Supports:
---------

Soundblaster - tested with AWE32, and lots of people have said it works with a
variety of other cards. Make sure you've got your soundcard driver set up for
DOS (e.g. if you have a Soundblaster, a line starting 'SET BLASTER=' in your
c:\autoexec.bat file).

Uses ports:
-----------

&H3DA - for vertical retrace

&H388
&H389 - for Adlib sound

&H3C6
&H3C8
&H3C9 - for palette setting

Uses memory locations:
----------------------

&H417 - to read the keyboard

Machine speed requirements:
---------------------------

Should run at full speed on any x86 processor.

When interpreted, rather than compiled, the program does all its work
within 15% of the vertical retrace cycle on a 486DX/66. The compiled
version should keep up with the vertical retrace on an 8086.

If you press the '=' key, the game will display how much of the vertical
retrace time the game takes up each cycle. Exciting, eh?

Unknown requirements:
---------------------

Base memory - tested with 479K free base memory
Memory manager - tested with himem.sys and emm386.exe


********** NOTES

1. The program does not attempt to detect a soundcard; it assumes a
Soundblaster is installed. Apparently it works ok on machines without a
soundcard, but can't guarantee it'll work on yours.

2. The player's bullet fire and explosion sound effects are pretty
dismal. I've found no information on how to use white noise on the
Soundblaster, so the program approximates with the tone channels.

3. The attract mode is minimal. I might add the original attract and
demo modes in the future.

4. The program simulates a monitor 256 pixels wide, as per the original (I
think). The background colour for this is set to a dark grey to attempt to
simulate a little bit of monitor wear and burn-in. I found the jet black of a
modern PC monitor was not quite authentic enough :-) If you cannot see the
grey background, try increasing your brightness and contrast controls.

5. There's no high-score table, because the original game didn't have one.

6. You can't re-assign the keys and it doesn't work with a joystick, sorry.

7. Quake it ain't. It's just a nostalgia trip.


********** NOTES ON THE SOURCE CODE

The file inv78-02.bas is the source code for the game. It's for QBASIC and it
compiles with QuickBasic 4.5. It runs, interpreted, within QBASIC easily at
full speed on a 486/66, probably on lower-powered machines, too.

The code is reasonably structured. I tend to sufffix variables with "s"
to mean "status", so the variable 'saucers' means 'saucer status'.

The SUBs and FUNCTIONs that start with "sb", e.g. "sbreset" are general-
purpose SoundBlaster routines that can be plugged into any program
without modification.

What else? Well, not much - it's a very simple program. Hope you find
it useful, though, if you're into this sort of thing!


********** HISTORY
